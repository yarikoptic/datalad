Description: data files management and distribution platform
 DataLad is a data management and distribution platform providing
 access to a wide range of data resources already available online.
 Using git-annex as its backend for data logistics it provides following
 facilities built-in or available through additional extensions
 .
  - command line and Python interfaces for manipulation of collections of
    datasets (install, uninstall, update, publish, save, etc.) and
	separate files/directories (add, get)
  - extract, aggregate, and search through various sources of metadata
    (xmp, EXIF, etc; install datalad-neuroimaging for DICOM, BIDS, NIfTI
    support)
  - crawl web sites to automatically prepare and update git-annex
    repositories with content from online websites, S3, etc (install
    datalad-crawler)
 .
 This package provides the command line tools.  Install without
 Recommends if you need only core functionality.
